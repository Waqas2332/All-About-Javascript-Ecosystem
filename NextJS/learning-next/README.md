# Nested Layouts

When making a specific layout a directory, keep in mind that the Root layout will also apply on that. It means you can't put another html tag in there because the whole website has only one html tag

# Loading Page

Each directory may have a loading page. As it takes some time to load the new page, that loading page will pe displayed while main page is being rendered by JS. It uses React Suspense under the hood
