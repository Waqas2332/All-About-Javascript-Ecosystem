# MERN Stack in Theory

## Planning the App

- Get the basic idea of the App

- Sketch the frontend

- Model the data on which you will work on both front and backend ( Enlist your entities and their attributes )

* Generalize API routes ( for endpoints which you need in the project )

* Generalize SPA routes for frontend ( for displaying the pages && also define which ones are open & which one are restricted )
